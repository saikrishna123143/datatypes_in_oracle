DATATYPES IN ORACLE:

Datatype tells,How much memory has to be allocated.
               which type should be accepted.
               valid range.

Types of oracle:

    1)Character related
        1.1 CHAR(N)
        1.2 VARCHAR2(N)
        1.3 LONG
        1.4 CLOB
        1.5 NCHAR(N)
        1.6 NVARCHAR(N)
        1.7 NCLOB
    2)Number related
        2.1 NUMBER(P)
        2.2 NUMBER(P,S)
    3)Datatype related
        3.1 DATE
        3.2 TIMESTAMP
    4)Binary related
        4.1 BFILE
        4.2 BLOB

1)CHARACTER RELATED:
   
        1.1 CHAR(N)

           * N is max no of characters accepted.
           * it is used to hold a set of characters.
           * it is fixed length data type.
                =>after assigning the characters,remaining filled with the spaces.
           * max ->2000bytes means 2000chars can be stored
           * default size 1

        1.2 VARCHAR2(N)

           * N is max no of characters accepted.
           * it is used to hold a set of characters.
           * it is variable length data type.
                    =>after assigning the characters,remaining not filled.
      
           * max ->4000bytes means 4000chars can be stored
       
           * no default value.

        1.3 LONG
           
            * More than 4000 chars,we use LONG.
            * Max size :2GB
            * In one table,we can
               ->we can only create one table as long type.
            * We didn't use built in functions on long type.
    
        1.4 CLOB
     
            * Character large object.
            * Max size :4GB
            * no conditions to be follow as like LONG.
            * It is better than the LONG.

        national character related:
           
            NCHAR,NVARCHAR,NCLOB:
                  
                  * These are following unicode.normal datatypes following ascii code.
                  * here we can store other language characters also.
                        ascii-1byte for one char.
                        unicode-2bytes for one char.
                  * NCHAR => 2000byptes=> 1000chars
                  * NVARCHAR =>4000bytes =>2000chars
                  * NCLOB => 4GB

2)NUMBER RELATED DATATYPE:
 
         2.1 NUMBER(P):
                 * P stands for precision.(max no of digits)
                 * precision max size(1 to 38)
                 * default value 38
         2.2 NUMBER(p,s):
                 * P stands for precision.
                 * S stands for scale.
                 example for understanding:
                          if we want store 
                                  NUMBER(5,2)
                                          123.67892345  => 123.68  STORED
                                          123.67492345  => 123.66  STORE
                

          
3)DATE & TIME RELATED DATATYPES:
         3.1  DATE

              * It is used to hold date values.
              * It is fixed length datatype.
              * Date order 
                  day:month:year:hours:minutes:seconds:AM/PM;
              *default time:
                  12:00:00 AM
              *size: 7 bytes

         3.2  TIMESTAMP:
              
             * It is extension of date type.
             * It can also hold fractional seconds
             * Fixed length datatype.
             * memory:11bytes

4)binary related:
       BFILE:
       BLOB:
